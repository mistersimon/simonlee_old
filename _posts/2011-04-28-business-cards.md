Finally ordered my business cards. Got slammed with taxes and shipping. Came out costing way more than i wanted. Whats up with showing shipping last minute companies? It ain’t cool…. They are so expensive i might even have to think twice about handing them out!

At least I have 500 super sick cards to hand out!
